absolutely nothing happened since changing the name doesn't actually change the file type. the file inherently is still a .txt document and will be opened by a text editor. furthermore, the bytes in the files are exactly the same as original; only the file name has changed, but the actual ASCII code remains unchanged so the size will too.

when i try to change the contents, i am not allowed to save it, but rather i am being given the option to save it as another individual file.
